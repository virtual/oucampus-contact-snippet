# OU Campus Contact Snippet Example

[Shoreline Community College Design Demo](https://virtual.github.io/shoreline/contact/index.html)

## Implementation Updates

- Enable select-lists usage
- Update /_resources/ou/editor/wysiwyg.css
- Add/update json at /_resources/ou/editor/select-lists
- Update FontAwesome library
- Update snippets.xsl 
 
## Snippet Considerations  

- Should we have an option for top-aligned contact box?
- Location (Simple)
- Types: phone, email, building (select list only), person, unformatted (eg room - number)
- Vertical version for managing in tight places/sidebar
- Hours (Simple)
- Documentation (removing/adding rows for multi-columns)
